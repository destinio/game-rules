# Unfathomable

## OVERVIEW

Unfathomable is a game of hidden loyalties, intrigue, and
paranoia for three to six players. Some players are humans who are
fighting for the survival of the ship, its passengers, and its crew. But
some players are traitors, sent aboard the SS Atlantica by the Deep
Ones to ensure the ship never reaches port! Because player loyalties
are hidden, determining who is friend and who is foe is critical to
winning in Unfathomable.

During the game, the human players arm themselves with items,
fight Deep Ones, rescue passengers, and make sure that the ship
stays afloat. At the end of every human player’s turn is a crisis that
either poses a difficult decision for one player or challenges all
players to work together to overcome the crisis. If the humans can
work together successfully, the ship will eventually reach port,
resulting in a win for the humans.

However, the traitors are hiding among the humans, secretly
sabotaging the ship and doing all they can to ensure its doom. If the
ship sinks before it can reach its final destination, the traitors win.

## OBJECT OF THE GAME

**For players who are loyal humans**

The object of the game is to usher the SS Atlantica to safety at its destination port of Boston. How this is accomplished is described later.

**For traitor players**

Loyal to the Deep Ones, the object of the game is to prevent the SS Atlantica from completing its voyage. This occurs if the ship is destroyed, overrun by Deep Ones, or depleted of any of its critical resources, all of which are described later.

Loyalty Cards

During a standard game of Unfathomable,
players are dealt a secret loyalty card to begin
the game (see the Rules Reference for standard
setup). For your first game, players start without
any loyalty cards in order to familiarize everyone
with the game rules in an atmosphere where
players can feel free to ask questions. Loyalty
cards will be dealt after each player has a chance
to take a turn. Until players are dealt a loyalty
card, they should assume (and play as though)
they are loyal humans.
```

## FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

### LOYALTIES

- Some players will be loyal to the humans trying to reach dry land, and some will be loyal to the Deep Ones intent on sinking the ship.
- loyalty cards remain secret.
- Three Types
  - Human
  - Hybrid
  - Cultist - for more people

### MONSTERS AND MONARCHS

- There are three types of monsters in the game
- Father Dagon
- Mother Hydra
- Deep Ones.
- Father Dagon and Mother Hydra are collectively referred to as **monarchs**.

### RESOURCES

- There are four resources critical for the ship’s survival, which are tracked by the four resource dials on the board.
  - FUEL: This dial represents the Atlantica’s fuel reserves.
  - FOOD: This dial represents the food and water required to keep the people aboard the ship alive.
  - SANITY: This dial represents the sanity and morale of the crew and passengers. Operating the ship becomes impossible if those aboard lose their grip on reality.
  - SOULS: This dial represents the people aboard the Atlantica, both passengers and crew. Operating the ship becomes impossible if there are too few people.
- During the game, loyal humans must ration and
  preserve these resources while traitors strive to deplete them.
- Typically, fuel is lost when the ship travels, food
  and sanity are lost when resolving crises, and souls are lost when
  passengers are defeated

### Skills

- Skills represent common abilities shared by the characters in the
  game. Players use their skills to defend or sabotage the ship and to
  bring about resolutions to the crises that affect all players.
- There are six skills in the game:
  - influence
  - lore
  - observation
  - strength
  - will
  - treachery
- Each character has their own skill set that is presented on their
  character sheet and determines which skills the character has access
  to during the game.

#### SKILL CHECKS

- Skill checks represent situations in which players work together as a
  group to resolve crisis situations.
- Because the loyalties and goals of
  each player are unknown, it is never completely clear who is working
  to help overcome the crisis, and who is working to make it worse.
- During a skill check, players can secretly add cards from their hand
  to the check in an effort to cause the check to pass or fail.
- Players cannot be certain who tried to help overcome the crisis and who tried to sabotage that effort because players add their cards in secret, along with random cards from a chaos deck.

### THE BOARD

#### THE DEEP

- a portion of the board that represents the depths of the ocean where the monsters muster and regroup.
- Monsters that are in the Deep **cannot** be affected by player abilities.

#### SPACES

- The portion of the board that depicts the SS Atlantica and the surrounding waters is divided into spaces.
- There are two types of spaces:
  - **Water spaces**
    - outermost spaces on the board.
    - Two of these spaces are numbered “1–4” and “5–8.”
      - These two spaces make up the front of the ship.
    - The water spaces at the opposite end of the board are the back of the ship.
    - Only monsters can move to water spaces. Characters cannot move to water spaces.
  - **Ship spaces**
    - Two subtypes:
      - **Deck spaces**
        - a ring around the interior spaces and are numbered from 1 to 8.
      - **Interior spaces**
        - Have a name and a brief description of their game function.
        - The complete text for these game effects is on the player reference sheets.
        - Most interior spaces have one or more numbers from 1 to 8.
        - The two interior spaces without numbers
          - The Brig
          - Sick Bay
    - Characters and Deep Ones **can** move to ship spaces.
    - Monarchs (Father Dagon and Mother Hydra) **cannot** move to ship spaces.
